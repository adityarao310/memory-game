# memory-game
Please use js, css and HTML files together for code to work.
Use gh-pages branch to directly make it work in the browser.

To play the game, you can either play it directly in the gh-pages branch
To setup the game locally, either clone or download the master branch,
then make sure you keep using all the files in the same folders as given
and do not change the paths.

How the game works:
--> You win the game by matching all tiles
--> When you click on the first tile, the timer will start 
--> When you click the 2nd tile, the new tile will display for a few seconds and then disappear if not matching
--> If matched, both the cards will turn green!
--> If you are stuck anywhere, refresh the game using the refresh button
--> To be a real pro, try getting 3 stars when finishing the game, by using less than 22 clicks :)
--> Some styling of the game might not display well in old browsers

Have fun!
